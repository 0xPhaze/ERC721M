# ERC721M

ERC721M allows for cheap and efficient staking.
Thus far, it has the cheapest gas costs on "minting and staking" directly.
The idea was first introduced in the [Mad Mouse Circus NFT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ad30c5e2985e960e89f4a28efc91ba73e104b77#code) project.

Implementation and tests are preliminary.
This should not be used in production until sufficiently tested.
I am not responsible for any damage caused using this contract.
